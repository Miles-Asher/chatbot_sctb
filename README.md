## Overview
**chatbot_sctb** is a user-friendly chatbot designed to answer specific questions about Seoul City Tour Bus services. It also provides personalized recommendations for cafes, restaurants, tourist attractions, and information about businesses around the tour routes. The chatbot is implemented via a Flask application hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, accessible at [http://15.165.204.98](http://15.165.204.98). 

This chatbot can also be integrated into other web and mobile applications using PHP or React via POST requests through cURL. It supports multiple languages and retains conversation history to provide context-aware responses.

```
Include your message in the request, and the chatbot's response will be returned in JSON format. This can be processed within your app as needed.

### Example cURL Command

## Configuration

If running the project locally, ensure you configure your OpenAI API key as an environment variable in a `.env` file located in `/chatbot_sctb_py/`:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

---

## Testing
Testing is best performed by running the chatbot locally and interacting with it through the built-in UI. If the chatbot consistently provides incorrect responses, you can correct the answers by sending the following message format:
```
/correct <question> | <answer>
```
This will update the chatbotâ€™s CSV file, ensuring more accurate future responses to similar questions.
